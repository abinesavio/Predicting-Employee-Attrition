# Predicting Employee Attrition: A Machine Learning Perspective

This repository contains the code and documentation for predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict employee attrition, which is a critical challenge faced by organizations worldwide. By leveraging historical employee data, we aim to identify patterns and factors contributing to attrition, enabling proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes such as employee demographics, job satisfaction, performance ratings, and other relevant factors. It includes both employees who have left the organization (attrited) and those who are still employed.

## Methodology

We explore different machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forest, XGBoost, and support vector machines (SVM), to build predictive models. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess model performance.

## Implementation

The project includes the implementation of machine learning models using Python and relevant libraries such as scikit-learn. We provide classification reports, confusion matrices, and feature importance analysis for each model.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to provide insights into employee attrition prediction and offer recommendations for organizations to mitigate attrition risks effectively.
